        <h3>Some things about Me</h3>

        <p>
            I do not have a favorite book, but right now I am reading a really good novel called "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."
        </p>
        
        <p>
           So far my favorite movie is the Avengers and right now I am binge watching Teen Wolf. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My favorite food is Thai food. I love going to a restaurant called Mai Thai.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In terms of music, I mostly listen to rock and pop music. My favorite band of all time is the Beatles.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My favorite color is blue. Go Team Mystic! lol
        </p>
        <p>
            If I am feeling down, I like to listen to Korean pop music, especially groups such as Girl's Generation, Super Junior, and EXO. Their music is very uplifting!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also really enjoyed learning about 2D animation! Here is a cute video I really enjoyed making: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p_JQk8dg7Q" target="_blank">My First Animation!</a>
